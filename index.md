# PyPortal Air Quality Display
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML

For my first milestone I made certain the air quality display on the PyPortal was working.  The first step in this was to connect the PyPortal to my computer and download all of the correct libraries into the CIRCUITPY file on my computer.  The next step was for me to connect the PyPortal display to my wifi by using the example code on the adafruit website.  This was the first issue I had since the PyPortal was displaying "AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'ssid'" , it turns out there was another library that was nessecary to the project that was not shown on the website.  The issue was that I was missing that library.  Finally, I had to input the zip code for my area and the air quality should be displayed.  The issue was that the PyPortal was not showing anything on it's screen and the serial console was displaying "Reply is OK! Response is -1" which is not a valid number for air quality.  The fix to this problem was a little easier, because it turns out my zipcode did not have data from the Air Quality Index used by the code from adafruit, so I changed the zipcode to the nearest one with data.  My plan for the future is to incorporate additional code to change the display and to assemble a magnetic case for the pyportal.


# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
